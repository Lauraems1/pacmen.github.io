# PackMen
#### Exercise: In this exercise you have two buttons "Add PackMan" and "Start Game". When you click the button "Add PackMan", a new packman will appear in the website. When you click the button "Start Game" the packman will move to a random direction with a random speed. You can add several packmen in a similar way.
#### Roadman of future improvements: I would like to use a similar code with other type of figures (such as balls, frogs, rabits...) and not only packmen
##### License: This exercise may be linked to a MIT license.
